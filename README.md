# üì° ESP8266 Deauther Project

This is an educational tool built using the ESP8266 microcontroller. It allows you to explore how 2.4GHz wireless networks operate and how devices can be affected by deauthentication packets and signal interference.

## üì∂ Features

- Scan for nearby WiFi networks and devices
- Send deauthentication packets to disconnect devices from access points
- Create fake access points (APs)
- Jam Bluetooth and WiFi signals on the 2.4GHz band
- Simple web-based interface for controlling the device
- Fully portable and USB-powered
