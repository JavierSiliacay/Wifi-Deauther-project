# 📡 ESP8266 Deauther Project

This educational tool is built using the ESP8266 microcontroller. It allows you to explore how 2.4 GHz wireless networks operate and how devices can be affected by deauthentication packets.

## 📶 Features

* Scan for nearby WiFi networks and clients  
* Send deauthentication packets to disconnect clients from access points  
* Create fake access points (APs) for testing  
* Simple web-based interface for monitoring and control  
* Fully portable and USB-powered  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is intended **for educational and research purposes only**. Please use it responsibly and **only on networks and devices you own or have explicit permission to test**.

It interrupts the whole 2.4 GHz band! Everything that works on 2.4 GHz WiFi/Hotspot can be affected.
